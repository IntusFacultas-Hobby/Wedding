    <paragraph>We canâ€™t wait to see you on the dance floor (dancing is mandatory). Keep this in mind when choosing your outfit!</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The venue has air conditioning, but June weather in Cincinnati can be unforgivingly hot and humid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>
      The general rule of thumb is
      <strong>semi-formal.</strong>

        <section-title>Ladies</section-title>
        <paragraph>Ladies, wear what you feel most comfortable in. If that means a dress, suit or skirt, then great!</paragraph>
        <paragraph>
          <strong>Note:</strong> The bride will be wearing red.

        <paragraph>Gentlemen, two-piece suits, sports jackets, or just a vest and tie are all great options for the event!</paragraph>
        <paragraph>We only ask that you avoid a three-piece suit, as the bridal party will be wearing three-piece suits.</paragraph>
